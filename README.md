# a silent disco for developers... 

Algorhythm is a silent disco for developers. It is a web application designed to bring developers together through a shared love of music. This social application enables anyone with a spotify account to share their favorite playlists globally. 

Algorhythm has the ability to generate comradierie within a single office workplace, could be used to connect freelancers all over the world, or could be utilized to discover new music. Our major aim with this project was to solve the problem of coworking remotely. Through sharing a favorite playlist, Algorhythm creates a global coworking environment where a developer in Chile could be coding along to the same playlist shared by a developer in California.
